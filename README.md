This website is designed to be used as a professional bio site. It was
made using the bootstrap framework to create a simple and clean design
that was easy to navigate and scaled well with different screens.

This site is deployed at: 
    https://iwasson.github.io

To run this code you need to download the repo and host it on any web 
platform. Whether that is Apache, Nginx, or GitHub pages

To build this website I referenced the bootstrap documenation:
