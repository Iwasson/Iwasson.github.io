        <p class="">
          My first introduction into the world of programming was during my
          junior year of high school. I took an AP computer science course and
          fell in love with the field. I am currently pursuing a degree in
          computer science at Portland State University (PSU). I am a current
          member of PSU Computer Action Team, where I am exploring system
          administration, web development and maintenance, as well as technical
          writing. After working at The Home Depot as a head cashier for several
          years, I interned at Novus Labs. There I learned the importance of
          quality assurance, as well as the underlying procedures that QA
          technicians follow to ensure functional products. My dream is to get
          into the field of robotic prosthetics, specifically programming the
          systems that power these devices.
